Break down any required tasks into smaller parallel workstreams that can be executed simultaneously. Assign different agents to handle: 1) Code analysis and testing, 2) Configuration validation, 3) Documentation updates, 4) Integration verification, and 5) Performance optimization. Ensure all agents work in parallel where possible to maximize efficiency and minimize total execution time."
