# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive end-to-end audit trail system for a Spring Boot Java application that processes data from multiple source systems. The system will use Oracle database with JdbcTemplate for audit data persistence and provide REST APIs for dashboard and reporting functionality. The system will provide complete traceability, data integrity verification, error diagnosis capabilities, and compliance reporting for a data processing pipeline that ingests files from mainframe systems, processes them through Oracle staging tables, applies business logic via Java modules, and generates final output files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to track data lineage from multiple source systems through the entire pipeline, so that I can ensure complete traceability and accountability for all data transformations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file arrives from any source system THEN the system SHALL log the file arrival with source system identification, correlation ID, and file metadata
2. WHEN data moves between pipeline stages THEN the system SHALL maintain the correlation ID to link all related audit events
3. WHEN processing data from different source systems THEN the system SHALL clearly identify and separate audit trails by source system identifier
4. IF multiple source systems are processed simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain distinct audit trails for each source while preserving overall pipeline correlation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a centralized audit logging mechanism using Oracle database, so that I can efficiently store, query, and analyze all pipeline audit events in one location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any audit event occurs THEN the system SHALL store it in a dedicated PIPELINE_AUDIT_LOG Oracle database table
2. WHEN storing audit events THEN the system SHALL include all required fields: auditId, correlationId, source_system, module_name, process_name, source_entity, destination_entity, key_identifier, checkpoint_stage, event_timestamp, status, message, and details_json
3. WHEN generating audit IDs THEN the system SHALL use UUIDs to ensure uniqueness across all audit events
4. WHEN storing timestamps THEN the system SHALL use UTC format for consistency across time zones
5. WHEN connecting to Oracle database THEN the system SHALL use Spring JdbcTemplate with Oracle-specific configurations and connection pooling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to track record counts and control totals at each checkpoint, so that I can verify data integrity and identify discrepancies between pipeline stages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are transferred from mainframe THEN the system SHALL log file size and hash for integrity verification
2. WHEN SQL*Loader processes files THEN the system SHALL capture and log rows read, loaded, and rejected counts
3. WHEN Java modules process data THEN the system SHALL log record counts before and after transformations
4. WHEN final files are generated THEN the system SHALL log record counts and control totals for reconciliation
5. IF record count discrepancies are detected THEN the system SHALL log WARNING status with detailed discrepancy information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Java developer, I want audit logging integrated into each processing module, so that I can track business rule applications and transformations at the module level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Java module applies business logic THEN the system SHALL log the module name, rule applied, and entity identifier
2. WHEN business rules transform data THEN the system SHALL capture input and output values in the details_json field
3. WHEN modules process entities THEN the system SHALL use key identifiers (like account numbers) for record-level tracing
4. IF a module encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log FAILURE status with error details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want automated reconciliation reports accessible via REST API, so that I can verify end-to-end data integrity and meet audit requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pipeline run completes THEN the system SHALL generate an automated reconciliation report stored in Oracle database
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL break down results by source system and make them available via REST endpoints
3. WHEN comparing counts THEN the system SHALL verify record counts from source files through Oracle loads to final output files
4. IF discrepancies are found THEN the system SHALL highlight them in the reconciliation report and expose via API
5. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include timestamps, correlation IDs, and summary statistics accessible through REST API
6. WHEN accessing reports THEN the system SHALL provide REST endpoints for report retrieval, filtering, and export functionality
7. WHEN accessing REST APIs THEN the system SHALL provide Swagger UI documentation for all endpoints with request/response examples

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a support engineer, I want a Spring Boot REST API-based dashboard to visualize audit data, so that I can quickly identify issues and trace problems to specific modules or source systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the audit dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide REST API endpoints with filters for source_system and module_name
2. WHEN filtering audit data THEN the system SHALL allow isolation of data flow for specific sources through API parameters
3. WHEN investigating issues THEN the system SHALL enable tracing problems to particular Java modules via REST endpoints
4. WHEN viewing audit events THEN the system SHALL provide REST APIs that return real-time status and historical trends in JSON format
5. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL highlight failed events through API responses and provide drill-down capabilities
6. WHEN consuming REST APIs THEN the system SHALL support pagination, sorting, and filtering query parameters
7. WHEN accessing API documentation THEN the system SHALL provide interactive Swagger UI with endpoint testing capabilities

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want checkpoint-based audit logging, so that I can capture audit events at critical pipeline transition points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files transfer from mainframe to RHEL THEN the system SHALL log Checkpoint 1 events with file arrival details
2. WHEN SQL*Loader ingests data to Oracle THEN the system SHALL log Checkpoint 2 events with load statistics
3. WHEN Java modules apply business logic THEN the system SHALL log Checkpoint 3 events with transformation details
4. WHEN final files are generated THEN the system SHALL log Checkpoint 4 events with output file metadata
5. WHEN any checkpoint fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error status and diagnostic information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a data steward, I want immutable audit records, so that I can ensure the integrity and reliability of the audit trail for compliance purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audit records are created THEN the system SHALL prevent modification or deletion of existing audit entries
2. WHEN storing audit data THEN the system SHALL use database constraints to ensure data integrity
3. WHEN accessing audit data THEN the system SHALL provide read-only access for reporting and analysis
4. IF system errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain audit log integrity and continue logging when possible
5. WHEN archiving old data THEN the system SHALL preserve audit trail completeness and accessibility
