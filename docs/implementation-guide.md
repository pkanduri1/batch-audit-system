# Implementation Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide for implementing the Batch Audit System following the structured task breakdown defined in the project specifications.

## Implementation Phases

The implementation is organized into four main phases, each building upon the previous phase to create a complete audit trail system.

3. **Testing** (Tasks 24-25): Create comprehensive tests for repository methods and database integration using @JdbcTest

### Phase 3: Service Layer (Tasks 26-33) - *PENDING*
**Objective**: Implement business logic and core audit services
**Current Status**: 0/8 tasks completed

#### Key Deliverables:
- CorrelationIdManager for thread-safe ID management
- AuditService with checkpoint-specific logging methods
- Oracle transaction management and error handling
- Comprehensive service layer unit tests

#### Critical Tasks:
1. **Correlation Management** (Tasks 26-28): Implement thread-local correlation ID management with proper cleanup
2. **Audit Service** (Tasks 29-32): Create core audit service with all four checkpoint logging methods
3. **Testing** (Tasks 33): Comprehensive unit tests with mocked dependencies

### Phase 4: API and Integration (Tasks 34-45) - *PENDING*
**Objective**: Implement REST APIs, security, and comprehensive testing
**Current Status**: 0/12 tasks completed

#### Key Deliverables:
- REST API controllers with pagination and filtering
- Request/response DTOs for API contracts
- Security configuration with role-based access control
- End-to-end integration tests with Oracle database

#### Critical Tasks:
1. **Swagger Configuration** (Task 34): Configure OpenAPI documentation
2. **REST API** (Tasks 35-39): Implement dashboard controller with audit events, reconciliation, and statistics endpoints
3. **Oracle Integration** (Tasks 40-42): Configure Oracle-specific settings and comprehensive database tests
4. **Production Readiness** (Tasks 43-45): Add error handling, security, and end-to-end integration tests

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Workflow

1. **Task Completion Order**: Follow the sequential task order to ensure proper dependency management
2. **Minimal Implementation First**: Generate only essential code needed to fulfill requirements, avoid over-engineering
3. **Testing Strategy**: Write tests for each component before moving to the next phase
4. **Database Changes**: Use Liquibase for all schema modifications, never modify existing changelogs
5. **Configuration Management**: Use environment-specific profiles for different deployment environments
6. **Layered Architecture**: Ensure controllers handle HTTP concerns only, services contain business logic, repositories handle data access
7. **Audit Event Processing**: Use @Auditable annotation for automatic audit capture with correlation ID tracking

### Code Quality Standards

#### Java Code Standards
- Follow Spring Boot best practices and conventions with minimal implementation first approach
- Use JdbcTemplate with Oracle-specific SQL operations and configurations
- Implement comprehensive error handling with custom exception hierarchy using @ControllerAdvice
- Write meaningful JavaDoc documentation for public APIs
- Leverage Spring's dependency injection and auto-configuration
- Use @Component, @Service, @Repository annotations appropriately
- Prefix audit-related classes with "Audit" (AuditService, AuditEvent)
- Use enum values in UPPER_CASE for audit statuses and stages

#### Database Standards
- Use UPPER_CASE naming for Oracle tables and columns
- Create indexes for all common query patterns
- Implement proper constraints for data integrity
- Use UUID primary keys for audit events

#### Testing Standards
- Achieve minimum 80% code coverage for service and repository layers
- Write unit tests for all service layer methods
- Create integration tests for repository operations
- Use @JdbcTest for repository testing with Liquibase
- Mock external dependencies in service tests
- Use test profiles to avoid impacting production data

### Configuration Management

#### Environment Profiles
```yaml
# Development Profile (application-dev.yml)
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:oracle:thin:@dev-oracle:1521/AUDIT
  liquibase:
    contexts: dev
    drop-first: false

# Production Profile (application-prod.yml)
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:oracle:thin:@prod-oracle:1521/AUDIT
  liquibase:
    contexts: prod
    drop-first: false
```

#### Security Configuration
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement JWT token validation for API access
- Configure role-based access control for audit endpoints
- Enable HTTPS for production deployments

### Performance Considerations

#### Database Optimization
- Use HikariCP connection pooling with appropriate pool sizes
- Implement batch processing for bulk audit operations
- Create composite indexes for common filter combinations
- Monitor query performance and optimize as needed

#### Application Performance
- Use async processing for non-critical audit operations
- Implement caching for frequently accessed audit data
- Configure appropriate JVM settings for production workloads
- Monitor memory usage and garbage collection patterns

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Database Connection Issues
1. **Oracle Driver Compatibility**: Ensure Oracle JDBC driver version matches database version
2. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: Monitor HikariCP metrics and adjust pool settings
3. **Liquibase Lock Issues**: Use `mvn liquibase:releaseLocks` to clear stuck locks

### Performance Issues
1. **Slow Queries**: Check index usage and query execution plans
2. **Memory Leaks**: Monitor correlation ID cleanup in CorrelationIdManager
3. **High CPU Usage**: Profile application under load and optimize bottlenecks

### Integration Issues
1. **Test Failures**: Ensure test database is properly configured with Liquibase
2. **API Errors**: Validate request/response DTOs and error handling
3. **Security Issues**: Check JWT token configuration and role mappings
